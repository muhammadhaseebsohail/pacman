Your test setup looks mostly correct, but there are a few changes that need to be made. 

First, the `getByRole` function from React Testing Library is not able to find elements by their CSS classes. Instead, it looks for HTML elements with specific ARIA roles. In this case, your `box` div does not have a role, so `getByRole('box')` will not be able to find it. 

To work around this, you could add a `data-testid` attribute to your div and use the `getByTestId` function instead:

```jsx
return <div className="box" style={{ transform: `translateX(${left}px)` }} data-testid="box" />;
```

Second, the `toHaveStyle` matcher from Jest might be unable to check for styles that are calculated at runtime. It would be better to mock the `useState` function to control the state of the component during testing, and then check if the state changes when the event is fired:

```jsx
import { render, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import SmoothControl from './SmoothControl';
import { useState } from 'react';

jest.mock('react', () => ({
  ...jest.requireActual('react'),
  useState: jest.fn(),
}));

test('checks if right arrow key moves the box', () => {
  const setLeft = jest.fn();
  useState.mockImplementation(init => [init, setLeft]);

  const { getByTestId } = render(<SmoothControl />);
  fireEvent.keyDown(window, { key: 'ArrowRight' });

  expect(setLeft).toHaveBeenCalledWith(10);
});
```

This setup will ensure that your test is robust and able to accurately check if the `SmoothControl` component behaves as expected.
