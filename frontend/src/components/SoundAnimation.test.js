Your test setup looks correct. However, you can enhance it by mocking the Audio object and checking if it's being called correctly when the component is clicked. Here's how you can do it:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { render, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import SoundAnimation from './SoundAnimation';

// Mock the HTMLMediaElement play function
window.HTMLMediaElement.prototype.play = jest.fn();

test('plays sound and animates on click', () => {
  const soundFile = 'test.mp3';
  const { getByTestId } = render(<SoundAnimation soundFile={soundFile} animation="test.png" />);
  const component = getByTestId('sound-animation');

  fireEvent.click(component);

  expect(component).toHaveClass('animating');
  expect(window.HTMLMediaElement.prototype.play).toHaveBeenCalled();
  expect(window.HTMLMediaElement.prototype.src).toBe(soundFile);
});
```

This test first mocks the `play` function of the `HTMLMediaElement` prototype which `Audio` objects inherit from. This allows us to check if `play` is called without actually playing the sound in tests.

The test then renders the `SoundAnimation` component and simulates a click on it. It checks if the `animating` class is added to the component and if `play` was called on an `Audio` object with the correct `src`.

Remember to add `data-testid="sound-animation"` to the component's root div in the actual component file for this test to work.
