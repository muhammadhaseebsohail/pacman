The task you've given isn't directly related to a specific React component, rather it's a performance optimization task. Creating an optimized React component doesn't necessarily ensure that the game will load within 3 seconds as it depends on many other factors such as network speed, server response time, overall codebase optimization, etc. 

However, I can show you how to create a React component with a "loading" state that lasts for a maximum of 3 seconds. This doesn't mean the game will load within 3 seconds, but it can be used to simulate a loader if the data or game assets aren't ready yet.

Here is how you could create such a component:

```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
import './Loading.css';

const Loading = ({ children }) => {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      setIsLoading(false);
    }, 3000);

    return () => clearTimeout(timer);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="loading-container">
      {isLoading ? <div>Loading...</div> : children}
    </div>
  );
};

Loading.propTypes = {
  children: PropTypes.node.isRequired,
};

export default Loading;
```

Here's the CSS:

```css
.loading-container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
}
```

This component will show a loading message for 3 seconds, then render its children. 

Basic test setup for this component would be:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import Loading from './Loading';

test('renders loading message', () => {
  render(<Loading />);
  const loadingElement = screen.getByText(/loading.../i);
  expect(loadingElement).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

Remember, this component doesn't guarantee that the game or any other assets will load within 3 seconds. It's just a way to show a loading message for a maximum of 3 seconds.
