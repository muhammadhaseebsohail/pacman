Apologies for the confusion in the previous message. Here's the correct unit test setup for the given component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { render, waitForElementToBeRemoved } from '@testing-library/react';
import Loading from './Loading';

describe('Loading', () => {
  it('should display the loading message initially', () => {
    const { getByText } = render(<Loading />);
    expect(getByText('Loading...')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('should remove the loading message after 3 seconds', async () => {
    const { getByText } = render(<Loading />);
    await waitForElementToBeRemoved(() => getByText('Loading...'));
  });
});
```

In this test setup, we're using Jest and React Testing Library. The `describe` function groups together multiple related tests. Inside `describe`, we have two tests: 

1. The first test ensures that the loading message is displayed initially. We do this by rendering the component and then checking if the text 'Loading...' is in the document.

2. The second test checks if the loading message is removed after 3 seconds. We again render the component and then wait for the 'Loading...' text to be removed from the document. The `waitForElementToBeRemoved` function is used to wait until the specified element is removed from the document. This function is perfect for testing loading states or any other scenarios where an element is expected to be removed from the UI after some time.
