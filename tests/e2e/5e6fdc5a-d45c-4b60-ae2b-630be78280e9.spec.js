Frontend Tests:

1. Unit Tests with Jest and React Testing Library:

   a. Test game controls:
      - Test if all controls are rendered properly.
      - Test if controls are responsive to user input.
      - Test edge cases where multiple controls are pressed simultaneously.

   b. Test game logic:
      - Test if the game state changes correctly based on user input.
      - Test error scenarios where invalid game actions are performed.

   c. Test game scoring:
      - Test if the score is updated correctly based on game events.
      - Test if the high score is maintained and updated correctly.

2. End-to-End Tests with Cypress/Playwright:

   - Test the entire flow of the game from start to finish.
   - Test if game controls, logic, and scoring work correctly together.
   - Test edge cases where unexpected actions are performed during gameplay.
   - Test if the game ends and resets correctly.
   
Backend Tests:

1. Unit Tests with pytest:

   a. Test game controls:
      - Test if the server correctly processes control input.
      - Test if the server correctly updates the game state based on controls.

   b. Test game logic:
      - Test if the server correctly applies game rules and logic.
      - Test error scenarios where the server receives invalid game actions.

   c. Test game scoring:
      - Test if the server correctly calculates and updates scores.
      - Test if the server maintains and updates the high score correctly.

2. Integration Tests:

   - Test if the server correctly integrates with the database for storing scores.
   - Test if the server correctly integrates with the frontend for receiving controls and sending game updates.

3. API Tests:

   - Test if the server correctly handles API requests for game controls, game state, and scores.
   - Test data validation and error handling for API requests and responses.

4. Performance Tests:

   - Test if the server can handle high loads of game events and controls.
   - Test if the server can maintain stable performance under stress.
