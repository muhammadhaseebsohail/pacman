Test Plan Document

1. Test Objectives
    - To ensure that all game controls function as expected
    - To validate that the game logic is correctly implemented 
    - To verify the accuracy of game scoring

2. Test Scope
    - Frontend: Game controls, User interface, and interaction
    - Backend: Game logic, Scoring mechanism, and Data validation

3. Test Cases with Expected Results
    - Test Case 1: Verify that all game controls are responsive and function as expected. 
        - Expected Result: All game controls respond to user inputs correctly and in a timely manner.

    - Test Case 2: Validate the game's logic.
        - Expected Result: The game should follow the established rules and respond to player actions according to the defined game logic.

    - Test Case 3: Confirm accuracy of game scoring.
        - Expected Result: The scoring mechanism should accurately track and display the player's score.

4. Test Data requirements
    - Valid game control inputs from both mouse and keyboard
    - Different game scenarios to test game logic
    - Different scores, including minimum, maximum, and average scores

5. Test Environment Setup
    - Frontend testing:
        - Jest and React Testing Library for unit tests
        - Cypress or Playwright for E2E tests
    - Backend testing:
        - Pytest for Python/FastAPI tests
        - Include API integration tests
    - Test data validation and error handling

6. Acceptance Criteria
    - All game controls must work as expected with no delays or unresponsiveness.
    - The game's logic must be correctly implemented and consistent with the game's rules.
    - The scoring mechanism must accurately tally and display the player's score.
    - The game must handle invalid inputs gracefully and display appropriate error messages.
    - The game must perform well under load and maintain responsiveness.

This plan ensures we have a thorough understanding of the game's functionality and performance and that we address and test all critical aspects of the game.
