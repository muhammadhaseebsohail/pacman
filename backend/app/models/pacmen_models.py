From the provided code, it looks like the API interacts with three main entities: Pacman, Ghost, and PowerPellet. The Pydantic request/response models for these entities have already been defined in the provided code.

However, there isn't a specific request/response model for the `eat_pellet` endpoint. We could define a simple response model to standardize the response:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class EatPelletResponse(BaseModel):
    message: str
```

Then, we can update the `eat_pellet` endpoint to use this response model:

```python
@app.put("/pacmen/{pacman_id}", response_model=EatPelletResponse)
def eat_pellet(pacman_id: int):
    """
    Pacman eats a power pellet.
    """
    # ... existing code ...

    return EatPelletResponse(message="Power pellet eaten, ghosts are now vulnerable!")
```

As for data transfer objects (DTOs), in this simple game scenario, we're treating the Pydantic models as DTOs since they're being used to transfer data between the client (request/response) and the server (in-memory storage).

In a more complex application with a database, we might have separate database models and use Pydantic models as DTOs to transfer data between the client and the service layer, and between the service layer and the database layer. In such a case, we would map between the database models and the DTOs in the service layer. This is not needed in the provided code since we're using a simple in-memory store.
