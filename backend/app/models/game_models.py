For this FastAPI application, the required Pydantic models have already been defined in the provided code. Let's take a quick look at each one:

1. `Dot`: This model is used to represent a single dot that Pac-Man can eat. Each dot is characterized by its position in the form of `x` and `y` coordinates.

```python
class Dot(BaseModel):
    x: int
    y: int
```

2. `PacMan`: This model is used to represent the Pac-Man character. Like the dots, Pac-Man's position is defined by `x` and `y` coordinates.

```python
class PacMan(BaseModel):
    x: int
    y: int
```

3. `GameRequest`: This model represents the data that the API expects to receive in a POST request to the `/game` endpoint. It includes the current position of Pac-Man and a list of dots.

```python
class GameRequest(BaseModel):
    pac_man: PacMan
    dots: List[Dot]
```

4. `GameResponse`: This model represents the data that the API will return in response to a POST request to the `/game` endpoint. It includes the current score and a list of the remaining dots.

```python
class GameResponse(BaseModel):
    score: int
    remaining_dots: List[Dot]
```

No additional data transfer objects (DTOs) are needed for this application. The Pydantic models themselves serve as DTOs, ensuring that the data sent in requests and responses is correctly structured and typed.
