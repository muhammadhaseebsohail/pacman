In the provided code, we are using WebSockets for real-time communication and sending raw data (not structured JSON), so there is no need to use Pydantic models for request and response. However, you could use Pydantic to validate the direction input. Here's how you could do it:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, ValidationError, validator
from fastapi import FastAPI, WebSocket, HTTPException
from enum import Enum
from typing import Optional

app = FastAPI()

class Direction(str, Enum):
    """Enumeration for Pac-Man movement directions"""
    up = "up"
    down = "down"
    left = "left"
    right = "right"

class Player:
    """Class representing a player"""
    def __init__(self):
        self.x = 0
        self.y = 0

    def move(self, direction: Direction):
        """Move the player in a specified direction"""
        if direction == Direction.up:
            self.y += 1
        elif direction == Direction.down:
            self.y -= 1
        elif direction == Direction.left:
            self.x -= 1
        elif direction == Direction.right:
            self.x += 1

player = Player()

class DirectionModel(BaseModel):
    """Pydantic model for direction validation"""
    direction: Direction

    @validator('direction')
    def direction_must_be_valid(cls, value):
        if value not in Direction:
            raise ValueError('Invalid direction')
        return value

@app.websocket("/ws")
async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket):
    """Websocket endpoint for controlling Pac-Man"""
    await websocket.accept()
    while True:
        try:
            data = await websocket.receive_text()
            direction_data = DirectionModel(direction=data)
            player.move(direction_data.direction)
            await websocket.send_text(f"Player moved {direction_data.direction}")
        except ValidationError as e:
            await websocket.send_text("Invalid direction")
        except Exception as e:
            await websocket.send_text(f"Error: {str(e)}")
```

In this updated example, we're using a Pydantic model `DirectionModel` to validate the direction sent by the client. If the direction is not valid, it raises a `ValidationError` which we catch in our WebSocket endpoint and send an "Invalid direction" message back to the client.
